# Dom Davis - Speaker Profile

My speaker profile, and some of the talks I have done in the past.

## Bio

If I'm speaking at one of your events, please feel free to use one of the
following bios.

### Software focused bio

Dom Davis is a veteran of The City and a casualty of The Financial Crisis. Not
content with bringing the world to its knees he then went off to help break the
internet before winding up in Norfolk where he messes about doing development
and devops. Dom has been writing code since his childhood sometime in the last
millennium – he hopes some day to become good at it.

Dom is an enthusiastic and impassioned speaker [read: he gabbles] who uses a
blend of irreverent sarcasm and flippant humour to bring complex subjects to a
broad audience. Whether or not they understand him is up for debate, but he
likes to believe they do.

### Management/Process focused bio

content with bringing the world to its knees he then went off to help break the
internet before winding up in Norfolk where he is now CTO of a tech startup.
